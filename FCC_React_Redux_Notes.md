# React and Redux Notes

## Getting Started with React Redux
React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state. 

In complex app it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux.

Use the `react-redux` package as it provides a way for you to pass Redux `state` and `dispatch` to your React components as props.
